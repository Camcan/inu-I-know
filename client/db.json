We were motivated by our understanding that bookings, even in the most pristegious of establishments, are often handled by voice-call, pen, & paper. BookIt is a workable concept that eliminates the seemingly limitless possibility of human error through a compact elegant yet succulent web-app. I worked together with Zachary Landes ( zacharylandes.github.io ) to create the client-facing interface of the service, which allows one to make bookings for specific numbers of people at their resteraunts of choice for a given timeframe, automating this entire process. Book It, because why talk to people. ",
